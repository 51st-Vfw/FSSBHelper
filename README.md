# FSSBHelper
RealSimulator FSSB R3 Axis Alerter

This is a small helper program for the RealSimulator FSSB base that outputs the axis
alerts (i.e., stick at max deflection) through the Windows audio subsystem. This makes
it easier to hear in VR or other environments where the FSSB base audio may not be
loud enough to be heard.

The alerts can be programmed through the UI to occur above a threshold of the stick
throw.

The UI is minimized to the system tray on launch and the application does not show up
in the Windows taskbar. To access the UI, double-click on the FSSBHelper icon in the
system tray. Minimizing the UI window will return it to the tray.
